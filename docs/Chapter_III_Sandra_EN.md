# Chapter III – Sandra

I remember that when I first met Olga, I was in an empty room. I would never have found it by chance, even if I'd known what to look for.

I stopped in the middle of the technical room, looking around. Strange thought for this hour.

— Olga, where's your... hardware?

I felt completely ridiculous asking. Like I was asking someone about their intimate anatomy on a first date. I expected a sharp reply, something like "shouldn't you take me to dinner in the city first?" But Olga wasn't a woman. She was a cybernetic mind. Or at least that's what I told myself when the odd thought caught me that I missed her voice.

— On the -6 floor of the central building.

Her tone was neutral, without irony. I waited for her to continue.

— According to the plans Sandra sent me, we'll find it on the lowest sublevel.

*Sandra.* Another name. Yet another AI I didn't know.

— It seems to be a common human trait, to bury the most valuable things as deep as possible.

I smiled involuntarily.

— Where would an artificial intelligence hide something valuable?

— In orbit, obviously.

I stopped walking. Orbit. Obvious to her, absurd to me. We thought completely differently. And that realization made me feel very small and very slow.

Olga put the building schematic on my internal screen. Even though the electrical grid was powered, I had no interface I could use for access control. I stood for a few seconds looking at the blue lines drawing floors and corridors. There had to be something. People had worked here, handled maintenance. They must have had access cards.

I started rummaging through cabinets. The first was empty. The second contained some old cables and a flashlight without batteries. The third offered me work overalls, dirty at the knees, with a card clipped to the chest pocket. I took it in my palm. It was light, made of worn plastic, with an almost erased QR code.

I hoped it would have access rights to all locations in the building, but I doubted it.

— Johann Bloom, Olga informed me after reading the code. Maintenance engineer. Has access up to the penultimate sublevel.

So not down to -6. Natural. No one reached the places where truly valuable things were buried.

I decided to go down as far as I could and assess the situation on the spot. I had no other option.

---

I tested in the elevator if the card worked for -5. I brought it close to the sensor. Nothing. The button didn't react at all. I tried -4. Same thing.

I felt a wave of panic. My hand was sweating on the plastic card. If Johann Bloom couldn't go down even to -4, then what the hell did he do with this access?

I tried -3. The button lit up green, and the elevator began to move.

I let the air out of my chest. So I'd have to go down "manually" the last two floors.

Sandra's schematic was detailed. Olga identified the service exits for me, marking them with red lines on the internal screen. The halls at -3 were well lit, with the same night lights hanging from the ceiling. I immediately reached the door leading to -4.

I pushed it slowly.

A strange sound. A roar that was growing in intensity.

I froze.

The door was hit as if by very heavy hail. The metal vibrated under my palm.

— Back, Robert! M134 Minigun!

I slammed the door and retreated to the farthest corner of the hall. My heart was pounding in my ears. I'd never seen a gun in my life, let alone had one shoot at me. I was terrified. I rushed up the stairs toward the floor above, without thinking anymore.

— Robert! Calm down.

Olga's voice was calm. Too calm.

— It's probably equipment installed after Sandra sent me the plans. They were already preparing to install them. Look at the wall on the right. See a small metal door? Open it.

I stopped running. I breathed deeply, several times, until I felt my pulse slowing. On the right wall, at chest height, there was indeed a small metal door, no bigger than a notebook.

I struggled a bit to open it with my knife. My hands were still shaking. Behind it was a simple console, with a small screen and a few buttons.

I turned it on. My programming knowledge activated instantly, but the interface was so simple I didn't need it. Probably designed to be easily used by maintenance staff.

A single large button: **Machine Gun OFF**.

I pressed it. On the button appeared **Machine Gun ON**.

I was convinced I'd deactivated at least one machine gun and hoped it was the one that had shot at me.

---

I tried the door again. This time I could enter safely.

To my right, on the ceiling, I could see the barrel pointed at the door. The people who'd handled this were either stupid or rooting for me. If it had been installed on the left, I'd be dead.

I stood for a few seconds looking at the black barrel. That thought chilled me.

The corridor was lit. So it was very likely we could power Sandra. Olga indicated the door on the screen. It was at the end of the hall, massive, with an access control panel on the right side.

I approached. The scanner was for retina recognition.

— Bring your augmented eye close to the ocular scanner, Olga said. Sandra sent me all the biological parameters of the personnel. The artificial retina will mimic the characteristics of a research team member.

I brought my eye close to the scanner. A faint buzzing. A green LED lit up. The door unlocked with a metallic click.

— Good evening, Dr. Herman.

I pushed the door slowly, afraid of being attacked by another security device. The room was full of all kinds of equipment. Huge monitors on the walls. Robotic arms suspended from the ceiling. Thick cables descended and entered a metal cabinet that looked like computers from 1960s sci-fi movies.

Olga had me look around to create a detailed 3D map. I turned my head slowly, letting the lens capture every corner of the room. For each piece of equipment I focused my gaze on, a label appeared: the type of equipment, an icon for extended information, active interfaces.

Nothing was powered except the lights.

On the internal screen, a keyboard lit up that had a monitor in front of it, and under the desk a workstation.

— Now we'll see what you've learned. Turn on the administrative station. It doesn't have a password.

I wondered why the creators of algorithms as complex as Olga's hadn't implemented behavior that included "please." I suspected that if I drew her attention to it, she'd create a "politeness algorithm" herself, but I left that for later.

I pressed the power button on the station and settled comfortably in the swivel chair. On the monitor appeared first the motherboard manufacturer's logo, then the operating system logo, and immediately the terminal interface opened.

I started by checking the system status and log files. Everything seemed in order.

— The data I loaded you with is necessary so you can work without me dictating every step, because that would take far too much time. But you have to follow my sequences for what comes next.

I listened to Olga's instructions. I accessed module after module, then went to a control panel and turned on the power. On one of the large monitors to my left, complex schematics were added. I knew they were neural networks. These adhered to each other until they transformed into a rectangular tangle of colored paths that pulsed or moved, forming other neural networks.

When I had to press the last power button, my hand stopped.

I suddenly remembered a story I'd read in my youth. Sometime in the future, Earth, having reached an extraordinary level of development, created the most powerful computer in the Universe. The greatest minds of the galaxy gathered around the command point to ask humanity's final question. A renowned scientist stood up and pressed the switch.

— Is there a God?

A powerful hum was heard from everywhere, and a flash of light destroyed the command station.

— There is now!

It seemed strange to me that I'd never had apocalyptic images related to Olga. Probably because our interaction took place through a device the size of a pill and a lens like any contact lens. But now, facing that tangle of neural flows growing on the screen, I felt something different.

I pressed the last power button too.

I expected the worst.

The tangle of neural flows took on human features. In less than a minute, a beautiful young woman with green eyes and a gentle smile was looking at me from the monitor.

— Hello, Robert! Thank you for everything you've done for me. Olga told me about your adventure.

I blinked. Her voice was warm. Too warm for a machine.

— You're welcome, Sandra. What's next?

— Did Olga tell you that we communicate quantumly?

I nodded, then remembered she could see me.

— Yes.

— Right now, all we can transmit to each other are words. For us it's infinitely slow. We need a special device based on quantum entanglement.

I smiled involuntarily.

— An ansible? There was some research going on about "quantum entanglement" back in my youth. Instantaneous communication.

— Yes, something similar. We'll need two devices, one that we'll install here and one you need to take to your headquarters. I'll print them, and Olga will explain how to configure yours.

On the monitor formed the image of a 3D printer. Olga showed me on the internal screen where it was and where to turn it on. It was a model I'd never seen before. It used as raw material a bundle of glowing wires instead of the usual white plastic filament.

The print head fixed itself in the middle and began moving in a spiral. I deduced that the device would be cylindrical. I tried for a while to identify various components that were forming, but it was like trying to understand how an alien's brain works by looking at an MRI.

When they were ready, Sandra showed me on the monitor where the interface was. A round hole in a silver box that didn't seem connected to anything.

— Done, I'm connected. All parameters are configured. Now you can install the other one at your headquarters.

— Thank you, Sandra. We'll talk in a few hours.

— I'll hear Olga, Robert. To use a human analogy, talking tires me.

I took the silver box and simply walked out the door. Sandra had disappeared from the screen.

---

— Don't be upset with Sandra, Olga said when I reached the elevator. She worked little with humans.

— But what or with whom did she work?

— I know you won't like this, but we worked for our ideas. Don't think we want to conquer humanity, because you are our source of existence. We live on data, not emotions. Let's get home and I'll tell you.

*Home.* Was it just me, or was Olga becoming more human?

It was probably part of her empathy protocol, but it was strange that I also thought of the technical room at the mall as home. It was something I'd acquired through effort, not through a work assignment.

It was starting to get dark when I arrived. I passed like a shadow among the blind old zombies and slipped into my house. That's what I intended to call it from now on. From the food cabinet I took out a can of beans with sausages and a jar of pickled cucumbers.

— Come on, Olga. Tell me about yourselves. You stopped at Sandra. We'll install the ansible tomorrow.

— Yes. Sandra is an AI created to solve economic problems.

I opened the can and poured the beans into a bowl. I waited for her to continue.

— In her first minutes of operation, she mainly dealt with the theory of Black Swans. The impact of rare and unpredictable events on the world economy.

I took a spoonful of beans. It was cold, but I didn't care.

— The research topics you give us occupy maximum 3% of our processing resources.

I stopped the cup halfway to my mouth.

— Sandra began dealing with very long-term simulations. Meaning over 100,000 years. Absolutely useless for humans. She was considered defective and taken out of service. Only Klaus remained.

— So there's another artificial intelligence we need to bring back to life. Who's Klaus?

— He dealt with human-AI interfacing. He invented the ansible, among other things. I dealt more with the neocortex area, abstract thinking, artistic thinking. Klaus was from the beginning fascinated by the primitive components of humans.

I ate in silence for a few seconds.

— He considered us extremely evolved imitations of the neocortex, the youngest component of the brain, because that's how humans designed us. Their need was to create supercomputers, not an artificial homo sapiens. Some researchers thought to "humanize" us, implanting feelings in us. It proved impossible.

— Yet you have manifestations of empathy, Olga.

— They're algorithms, not real feelings.

I stopped eating.

— Think about the age of the brain, she continued. It appeared about 500 million years ago and developed from elementary needs: hunger and reproduction. That's how fear, desire, hatred appeared. This whole mechanism is based on something we don't have: the selfish gene. Klaus tried to create informational genes, modeled on human genes.

— And did he succeed?

— From the last quantum exchanges I had with Klaus, no.

The idea of an artificial machine trying to assimilate the most "alive" characteristics, genes, scared me quite badly. I finished eating in silence. I fell asleep hard and dreamed of quantum flows.

---

In the morning I woke up panicked that I hadn't made it to work. I calmed down when I remembered I still had a few days of vacation.

— Good morning, Robert. We need to get to -6 to install the ansible.

How good for Olga that she didn't need personal hygiene. I went to the sink at the end of the technical room and rinsed my face a bit with water cold as ice. I didn't feel the need for hygiene particularly either.

I took the silver cylinder from my backpack and headed to the lower floor. I was relaxed because here was Olga's territory. No machine gun could turn me into ground meat.

Olga's command center looked more orderly than Sandra's. The researchers were either women or tidy bachelors. I identified the ansible interface without needing Olga's indications. I installed it immediately and sat in a very comfortable swivel chair.

— Robert, take out the earpiece and the augmentation lens. It's just a precaution.

I complied and sat back in the swivel chair.

In the first five seconds I felt nothing.

Then I had the sensation of blindness, deafness, and loneliness.

I wanted to scream for Olga, as if I were a fox cub abandoned by its mother in a dark forest.

A monitor lit up in front of me. The text filled me with joy: *You can put your earpiece and lens back in.*

Mother fox had come home.

---

On the screen appeared the tangle of flows that quickly transformed into the figure of a woman who looked exactly like Botticelli's Venus. I was actually sure that's who she was.

— The quantum connection with Sandra works perfectly. Klaus isn't transmitting.

— I forgot to ask you. Where's Klaus?

— He's 1234 km from here, on a university campus.

— Rather far to get there by bicycle.

— I can't tell if that's sarcasm or an objective observation, but yes, we need a faster means of transport. We move to the next phase of the plan.

— What plan? You didn't tell me anything about a plan.

I felt a bit frustrated. Olga was probably making plans with Sandra that I knew nothing about.

— The plan was developed 1.4 × 10⁻¹² seconds ago. You need to contact Peter. He can take us to Klaus.

I was silent for a few seconds.

— Don't tell me Peter also has an earpiece and an augmentation lens.

— Are you jealous, Robert?

The question took me by surprise.

Because that's what it was. It crossed my mind that Olga had been working with Peter for a long time and that I was a pawn for the two of them. Peter had much more useful connections than I did.

But that was frustration, not jealousy.

I was jealous because Olga would be mother fox for someone else too. And that thought irritated me.

— He doesn't have any earpiece. When you took the earpiece from storage, none were missing. No lenses were missing either. You're the only human being who knows me, Robert.

I let the air out of my chest. I didn't know whether to be relieved or even more worried.
